# Code is a Paintbrush

I will say this first: code can be easy! It may not always be approachable and carries a prejudice of being a complicated matter for “smart people”. And I don’t think that’s true! If you are curious but on the fence, you are in the right place! Come talk to me, and I promise we’ll make it happen!

Code is just like talking or writing a message to a computer in a language you can both understand. It is all about sharing a singular meaning for words and syntax. Humans have a more flexible sense for words and as such misunderstanding happens, generates arguments, this same mismatch shows as unintended behaviour, also called a bug... soon to be a feature?

So, think about code as a way of conversing with a computer to co-create something. Most computers may not have a screen but they are not limited to pixels, what you will simulate is up to you, it does not even have to be real! Code is a dream machine power house!

Coded art is also just the beginning of the journey, once you observe the result of your program and find something you would like to share with the world, how will you do it? As a web app? As a pen plotted artwork? As an immersive experience? As a song? As a watch???
